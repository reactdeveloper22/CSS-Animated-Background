# CSS Animated Background Collection

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can help you do more than just determine colors, fonts, or the positioning of certain elements. You can use CSS to create trendy animations and visual effects. You don’t need to know JavaScript or even HTML and create different kinds of animations and environments on your website.

This is a particle animation. You do not need JavaScript to build it. The whole idea of this background is to have particles moving randomly. Mank-image property creates a vignette effect.

#### Floating Color Orbs
Created by Alison Quaglia <br>

This animation uses Sassy CSS to achieve a multicolor floating orb effect. The colors are random and the orbs move slowly all over the screen. If you pay close attention you will see that each ‘orb’ is in reality represented by text. They are actually randomly generated shadows of a full point punctuation mark.

#### Spipa circle
Created by Alex Andrix <br>

The creator of this animation was inspired by his trip to Tunisia where he wandered around following a stranger who insisted on showing him something.

The animation resembles a number of random forcefields that move in a labyrinth-resembling manner and never hit one another. After a certain number of steps, a spot becomes free.

#### Pure CSS Background Image Scroll Effect
Created by carpe numidium <br>

This background only animates when you scroll. In the code, attach the fixed background image to the HTML. Assign an additional red color gradient with transparency and mixed-blend-mode to the body. The mixed-blend-mode property is responsible for determining how an element’s content will blend with the content of the element’s parent and background (MDN).

#### CSS Multiple Background Image Parallax Animation

This is another example of the parallax effect that gives your 2D background the illusion of depth. Using pure CSS you can layer background images one on another and then make them move at random speeds and in different directions.
